xamarin-rest-client
===================

Xamarin Forms Mobile application that consumes the skills rest data.

Instructions
===================

* Make sure to clone and follow the instructions for the java-spring-rest-server project
* Clone this project
* Open it with Xamarin Studio 5.0+
* Launch it

Notes
===================

I do not have access to Xamarins IOS Licence but it should work fine on there as well if you add an IOS project to the solution.
